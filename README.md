**FSD-Bot-Socket** is a Python script designed to establish communication with an FSD (Flight Simulation Data) server using sockets. It allows you to monitor and interact with various events, such as ATC (Air Traffic Control) controllers and pilots going online and offline, within a flight simulation environment.

This repository contains the Python version of the FSD-Bot-Socket script. Simply configure the settings and run the script to start monitoring flight simulation activities.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: The script establishes a connection to the FSD server and monitors activities such as ATC controllers and pilots logging in and out.

- **Interactive Responses**: Based on server messages, you can implement custom functionality when an ATC controller or pilot goes online or offline. This makes it a versatile tool for managing flight simulation sessions.

## Dependencies

Before running the script, make sure you have the required modules installed:

- `socket`
- `time`

You can install these modules using pip:

```bash
pip install socket
```

```bash
pip install time
```

## Usage
1. Configure the user settings in the script.
2. Run the script using Python: python ***FSD-Bot-Socket.py***.
3. The script will establish a connection to the FSD server and start monitoring relevant events.
